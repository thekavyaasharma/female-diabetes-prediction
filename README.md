## 🎯 About The Project

Early diabetes detection can be life-changing. This project harnesses the power of **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** to predict diabetes risk in female patients based on clinical measurements. Trained exclusively on the renowned Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, our model achieves impressive accuracy while maintaining excellent generalization.

### ✨ Key Highlights

-  **77.9% Accuracy** on unseen test data
-  **7 Clinical Features** for comprehensive assessment
-  **No Overfitting** - Model generalizes beautifully
-  **Real-time Predictions** with custom predictive system
-  **Clean Dataset** - Ready for immediate analysis

---

## 📊 Dataset

We utilize the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, a landmark dataset containing diagnostic measurements from female patients of Pima Indian heritage aged 21 years or older.

**📁 Source:** [Kaggle - UCI ML Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

**Why this dataset?** The Pima Indians population has one of the highest incidences of diabetes worldwide, making this dataset particularly valuable for medical research and predictive modeling.

|  **Pregnancies** | Number of times pregnant | Gestational diabetes risk factor |
|  **Glucose** | Plasma glucose concentration | Primary diabetes indicator |
|  **Blood Pressure** | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) | Cardiovascular health marker |
|  **Skin Thickness** | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) | Body fat distribution indicator |
|  **Insulin** | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) | Insulin resistance assessment |
|  **BMI** | Body mass index (weight/height²) | Obesity indicator |
|  **Diabetes Pedigree** | Genetic predisposition function | Family history impact |
|  **Age** | Age in years | Risk increases with age |

## 🔮 Making Predictions

Use our intuitive predictive system to assess diabetes risk:

```python
# Example: Predict for a new patient
patient_data = [6, 148, 72, 35, 0, 33.6, 0.627, 50]
prediction = model.predict(scaler.transform([patient_data]))

if prediction[0] == :
    print("✅ Low diabetes risk")
else:
    print("⚠️ High diabetes risk detected")
```
